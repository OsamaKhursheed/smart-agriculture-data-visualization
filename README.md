# Smart Agriculture: Data Visualization & Crop Type Classification

This project, completed as part of the **CS326 Artificial Intelligence & Expert Systems** course at **Usman Institute of Technology (affiliated with NED University)**, applies AI and data visualization techniques to improve decision-making in agriculture. Using soil, climate, and fertilizer data, we predicted suitable crop types and created visual insights for farmers and researchers.

## 📌 Project Overview

* **Goal:** Predict suitable crops based on soil nutrients, climate conditions, and fertilizer data.
* **Dataset:** Kaggle dataset (India) containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall values.
* **Key Focus:** Data cleaning, visualization, and model comparison.

## 🛠 Features

* Data cleaning (including simulated impurities and recovery)
* Visualizations with **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**
* Implemented 4 ML models: **SVC**, **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, **Naive Bayes**
* Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Comparative charts & confusion matrices

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model           | Accuracy  | Precision | Recall    | F1-Score  |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Naive Bayes** | **98.2%** | **98.3%** | **98.2%** | **98.2%** |
| SVC             | 97.9%     | 98.2%     | 97.9%     | 97.9%     |
| Decision Tree   | 97.3%     | 97.4%     | 97.3%     | 97.2%     |
| KNN             | 96.6%     | 97.0%     | 96.6%     | 96.5%     |

**Best Model:** Naive Bayes – balanced highest accuracy with lowest false positives and false negatives.

## 🖥 Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
